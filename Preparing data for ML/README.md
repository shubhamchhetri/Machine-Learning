## Preparing Data for Machine Learning

As Machine Learning explodes in popularity, it is becoming ever more important to know precisely how to prepare the data going into the model in a manner appropriate to the problem we are trying to solve.
In this course, Preparing Data for Machine Learning* i have gain the ability to explore, clean, and structure your data in ways that get the best out of your machine learning model.
First, i have learn why data cleaning and data preparation are so important, and how missing data, outliers, and other data-related problems can be solved. Next, i have discover how models that read too much into data suffer from a problem called overfitting, in which models perform well under test conditions but struggle in live deployments. I understood how models that are trained with insufficient or unrepresentative data suffer from a different set of problems, and how these problems can be mitigated.
Finally, by applying different methods for feature selection, dealing with missing data using imputation, and building a models using the most relevant features.
