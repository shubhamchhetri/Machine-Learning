## Preparing Data for Machine Learning

As Machine Learning explodes in popularity, it is becoming ever more important to know precisely how to prepare the data going into the model in a manner appropriate to the problem we are trying to solve.
In this course, Preparing Data for Machine Learning* I have gained the ability to explore, clean, and structure your data in ways that get the best out of your machine learning model.
First, I have learned why data cleaning and data preparation are so important, and how missing data, outliers, and other data-related problems can be solved. Next, I have discovered how models that read too much into data suffer from a problem called overfitting, in which models perform well under test conditions but struggle in live deployments. I understood how models that are trained with insufficient or unrepresentative data suffer from a different set of problems, and how these problems can be mitigated.
Finally, by applying different methods for feature selection, dealing with missing data using imputation, and building models using the most relevant features.


## Creating Machine Learning Models
As Machine Learning explodes in popularity, it is becoming ever more important to know precisely how to frame a machine learning model in a manner appropriate to the problem we are trying to solve, and the data that we have available.
In this course, Creating Machine Learning Models I have gained the ability to choose the right type of model for your problem, then build that model and evaluate its performance.
First, I have learned how rule-based and ML-based systems differ, and their strengths and weaknesses, and how supervised and unsupervised learning models differ from each other.
Next, I have discovered how to implement a range of techniques to solve the supervised learning problems of classification and regression. Also, I have gained an intuitive understanding of the model algorithms that can use for classification and regression. 
Finally, round out my knowledge by building clustering models using a couple of different algorithms, and validating the results.


## Designing a Machine Learning Model
As Machine Learning explodes in popularity, it is becoming ever more important to know precisely how to frame a machine learning model in a manner appropriate to the problem we are trying to solve, and the data that we have available.
In this course, Designing a Machine Learning Model I have gained the ability to appropriately frame our use-case and then choose the right solution technique to model it.
First, I have learned how rule-based systems and ML systems differ and how traditional and deep learning models work. Next, I have discovered how supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques differ from each other. Learning how classic supervised learning techniques such as regression and classification complement classic unsupervised techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. And also understood the assumptions and outcomes of these four classes of techniques and how solutions can be evaluated.
Finally, I have to design end-to-end ML workflows for canonical ML problems, ensemble learning, and neural networks.


## Deploying Machine Learning Solutions
Machine Learning is exploding in popularity, but serious early warning signs are emerging around the performance of ML models in production.
In this course, Deploying Machine Learning Solutions I have gained the ability to identify reasons why models might be under-performing in production after doing just fine in training and testing, and ways to mitigate this worrying phenomenon.
First, I have learned how training-serving skew, concept drift, and overfitting are different causes of model underperformance, and how they can be mitigated by post-deployment monitoring.
Next, I have discovered how ML models can be deployed, that is made available on HTTP endpoints, using Flask, the popular Python web-serving framework. Also, I have the knowledge of how I can deploy models to serverless environments such as Google Cloud Functions
Finally, I have learned how to work with platform-specific machine learning services such as Google AI Platform and Amazon SageMaker for model deployment.
