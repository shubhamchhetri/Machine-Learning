## Preparing Data for Machine Learning
As Machine Learning explodes in popularity, it is becoming ever more important to know precisely how to prepare the data going into the model in a manner appropriate to the problem we are trying to solve.

In this course, Preparing Data for Machine Learning* you will gain the ability to explore, clean, and structure your data in ways that get the best out of your machine learning model.

First, you will learn why data cleaning and data preparation are so important, and how missing data, outliers, and other data-related problems can be solved. Next, you will discover how models that read too much into data suffer from a problem called overfitting, in which models perform well under test conditions but struggle in live deployments. You will also understand how models that are trained with insufficient or unrepresentative data suffer from a different set of problems, and how these problems can be mitigated.

Finally, you will round out your knowledge by applying different methods for feature selection, dealing with missing data using imputation, and building your models using the most relevant features.

When you’re finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge to identify the right data procedures for data cleaning and data preparation to set your model up for success.

##Designing a Machine Learning Model


As Machine Learning explodes in popularity, it is becoming ever more important to know precisely how to frame a machine learning model in a manner appropriate to the problem we are trying to solve, and the data that we have available.

In this course, Designing a Machine Learning Model you will gain the ability to appropriately frame your use-case and then choose the right solution technique to model it.

First, you will learn how rule-based systems and ML systems differ and how traditional and deep learning models work. Next, you will discover how supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques differ from each other. You will learn how classic supervised learning techniques such as regression and classification complement classic unsupervised techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. You will then understand the assumptions and outcomes of these four classes of techniques and how solutions can be evaluated.

Finally, you will round out your knowledge by designing end-to-end ML workflows for canonical ML problems, ensemble learning, and neural networks.

When you’re finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge to identify the correct machine learning problem setup, and the appropriate solution technique for your use-case.

## Deploying Machine Learning Solutions
Machine Learning is exploding in popularity, but serious early warning signs are emerging around the performance of ML models in production.

In this course, Deploying Machine Learning Solutions you will gain the ability to identify reasons why models might be under-performing in production after doing just fine in training and testing, and ways to mitigate this worrying phenomenon.

First, you will learn how training-serving skew, concept drift, and overfitting are different causes of model underperformance, and how they can be mitigated by post-deployment monitoring.

Next, you will discover how ML models can be deployed, that is made available on HTTP endpoints, using Flask, the popular Python web-serving framework. You will also see how you can deploy models to serverless environments such as Google Cloud Functions

Finally, you will work with platform-specific machine learning services such as Google AI Platform and Amazon SageMaker for model deployment.

When you’re finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge to identify issues with models that have been deployed but are not performing to expectations, as well as how to implement deployment using both on-prem and cloud infrastructure.
