## Deploying Machine Learning Solutions
Machine Learning is exploding in popularity, but serious early warning signs are emerging around the performance of ML models in production.
In this course, Deploying Machine Learning Solutions i have gain the ability to identify reasons why models might be under-performing in production after doing just fine in training and testing, and ways to mitigate this worrying phenomenon.
First, i have learn how training-serving skew, concept drift, and overfitting are different causes of model underperformance, and how they can be mitigated by post-deployment monitoring.
Next, i have discover how ML models can be deployed, that is made available on HTTP endpoints, using Flask, the popular Python web-serving framework.Also i have the knowledge of how i can deploy models to serverless environments such as Google Cloud Functions
Finally, i have learned how to work with platform-specific machine learning services such as Google AI Platform and Amazon SageMaker for model deployment.
