## Creating Machine Learning Models
As Machine Learning explodes in popularity, it is becoming ever more important to know precisely how to frame a machine learning model in a manner appropriate to the problem we are trying to solve, and the data that we have available.
In this course, Creating Machine Learning Models i have gain the ability to choose the right type of model for your problem, then build that model, and evaluate its performance.
First, i have learn how rule-based and ML-based systems differ and their strengths and weaknesses and how supervised and unsupervised learning models differ from each other.
Next, i have discovered how to implement a range of techniques to solve the supervised learning problems of classification and regression.Also i have gain an intuitive understanding of the the model algorithms that can use for classification and regression. 
Finally, round out my knowledge by building clustering models using a couple of different algorithms, and validating the results.
