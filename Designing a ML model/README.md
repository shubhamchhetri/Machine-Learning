## Designing a Machine Learning Model
As Machine Learning explodes in popularity, it is becoming ever more important to know precisely how to frame a machine learning model in a manner appropriate to the problem we are trying to solve, and the data that we have available.
In this course, Designing a Machine Learning Model I have gained the ability to appropriately frame our use-case and then choose the right solution technique to model it.
First, I have learned how rule-based systems and ML systems differ and how traditional and deep learning models work. Next, I have discovered how supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques differ from each other. Learning how classic supervised learning techniques such as regression and classification complement classic unsupervised techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. And also understood the assumptions and outcomes of these four classes of techniques and how solutions can be evaluated.
Finally, I have to design end-to-end ML workflows for canonical ML problems, ensemble learning, and neural networks.
